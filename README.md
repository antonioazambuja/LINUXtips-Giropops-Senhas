Below have some descriptions and decisions about tools used in this project:

## Fork

This project is a fork of [badtuxx/giropops-senhas](https://github.com/badtuxx/giropops-senhas). I'm participating in the LinuxTips PICK and we task as a students was developing full project using more latest tools knowledged in the course and based in this fork repository application **Giropops Senhas**.

## Developing Docker image

I used Python [Chainguard](https://www.chainguard.dev/) image with free account available. This image base is Distroless, then my objective was built this project free vulnerabilities and with base image more lower size possible with objective increase pull on my K8s cluster.

### Optimizing

I used Chainguard Distroless base image and multistage build on Python environment. More details about: [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

### Trivy - Security Scan


I used [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) to security scan in base image developed. Below you can view latest scan performed in the image.

**Performed in: November 26th, 2024.**

## Running

For running this project look steps above:

- Choose how to run your cluster. I'm running on Kind cluster locally:
```
kind create cluster --config kind/cluster.yaml
```
- Install kube-prometheus to instrument your application on Prometheus with ServiceMonitor CRD. More details about installation method in the Github repository: https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus.
- 
```
git clone 
```

## CI

I used Github Actions to create CI on this project. When new push is performed in the branches `main` and `develop` these steps are executed:
- Docker Hub login;
- Docker build;
- Run Trivy scan to search any vulnerabilities;
- Build and push to Docker Hub;

## Load Test

I used K6 to run load test on application. Using K6 my objective was ensure application receive 1000 rpm
