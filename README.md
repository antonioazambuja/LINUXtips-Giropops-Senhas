This project was created on the PICK [LinuxTips](https://www.linuxtips.io) and have objective allow practice my abilities in Security Practices, Resource Efficient, Monitoring and Automation.

## Project tasks

### TODO
- [ ] Dashboard Giropops Senhas with Prometheus+Grafana;
  - [ ] Add step to Docker image scan vulnerabilities;
- [ ] Load Test with K6 (min TP: 1000 rpm without any errors);
- [ ] K8s resource analysis after Load Test;
- [ ] Open Github Pull Request;

### WIP

- [ ] README.md:
  - [ ] What's your decisions and process used in this project;
- [ ] CI/CD with Github Actions:

### DONE

Below have some descriptions and decisions about tools used in this project:

## Fork

This project is a fork of [badtuxx/giropops-senhas](https://github.com/badtuxx/giropops-senhas). I'm participating in the LinuxTips PICK and we task as a students was developing full project using more latest tools knowledged in the course and based in this fork repository application **Giropops Senhas**.

## Developing Docker image

I used Python [Chainguard](https://www.chainguard.dev/) image with free account available. This image base is Distroless, then my objective was built this project free vulnerabilities and with base image more lower size possible with objective increase pull on my K8s cluster.

### Optimizing

I used Chainguard Distroless base image and multistage build on Python environment. More details about: [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

### Trivy - Security Scan


I used [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) to security scan in base image developed. Below you can view latest scan performed in the image.

**Performed in: November 26th, 2024.**
